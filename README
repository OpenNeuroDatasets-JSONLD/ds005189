In this experiment, participants searched for objects in some scenes and intentionally memorized others. We then tested their memory of these objects, finding stronger (quantitative difference) and different (qualitative difference: recollection benefit) memory representations for search targets.

We recorded both EEG and eye movements. Behavioral data is split into encoding (Encode_beh) and memory testing (Test_beh).
